## Heart Disease Prediction Using Neural Networks

This project leverages a neural network to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical data. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, cholesterol level, blood pressure, heart rate, and other key health indicators that are essential for assessing heart disease risk.

### Project Workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Before feeding the data into the neural network, it is cleaned and normalized to ensure that all features have the same scale. This step is crucial for improving the performance of the neural network, as differences in scale between features can bias the model during training.

2. **Dataset Splitting:**  
   The dataset is split into two subsets: one for training (80% of the data) and another for testing (20%). This ensures an unbiased evaluation of the model's accuracy once it has been trained.

3. **Neural Network Implementation:**  
   The neural network is implemented using the Keras API within TensorFlow. The architecture consists of several fully connected (dense) layers with ReLU activations. A sigmoid activation function is used in the output layer to handle the binary classification problem of predicting heart disease presence or absence.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**  
   The model is trained using the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on the testing dataset. Accuracy and loss metrics are used to monitor the training process and evaluate the effectiveness of the model on unseen data.

### Features:
- **Input features:**  
  Age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, and more.
  
- **Target:**  
  Binary output where `1` indicates the presence of heart disease and `0` indicates its absence.

### Conclusion:
This project is an excellent starting point for those interested in applying deep learning to medical data analysis. The neural network can be trained further, fine-tuned, or adapted to different medical datasets for more advanced predictive modeling in healthcare. It showcases how machine learning can assist in the prediction of critical health outcomes, making it a valuable tool for researchers and developers in the healthcare domain.
